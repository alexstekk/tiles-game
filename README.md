# Memory card game

## Description 
The page consists of a board of tiles (default 4x4). 
- every 2 tiles have the same image 
- each tile is closed, so the user can not see a image. 
The gameplay is the sequence of rounds. In each round the user should select 2 tiles with the same image to make them flipped. The game is considered to be over when all of the tiles are opened.
